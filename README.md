# Tic-Tac-Toe Game
Welcome to the Tic-Tac-Toe Game! This is a simple and classic game that you can play against another player. The goal of the game is to get three of your marks in a row, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally, before your opponent does.

## How to Play
The game is played on a grid of 3x3 squares.
Each player takes turns marking one of the empty squares with their designated symbol. Player 1 is usually 'X', and Player 2 is usually 'O'.
The first player to get three of their marks in a row wins the game.
If all the squares are filled and no player has won, the game ends in a tie.
